The domain of the application that we are going to model is the movie theatre. We will focus on how the data is stored in the movie theatre and how the data work. We provide the information that shows in the movieâ€™s theatre, which includes location, name and the rating for the theatre. Each theatre must play movies, and movies have a unique ID, name, and type of movies. There are two genres of movies, profitable and non-profitable. For profitable movies, we will record its box office, which is used to win the award. For each award, it has the reward name which is unique and the bonus. For nonprofitable movies, all of the peripheral merchandise will be sold by the unique theatre. Each product has its ID and price. Movies Critic will also be stored, they have the rating for the movie.

Inside the theatre, they will provide snacks. We will store customer information, such as name, phone number, id and email. We also have a customer representative to help customers with any questions.

We will create a website for this project. Our website will be using HTML, CSS, javascript as our frontend, PHP as our backend, and MySQL as the database.
